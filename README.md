# swisscovery UNIGE

This repo contains the code and documentation about tools and personalizations made by the Library of the University of Geneva for the discovery interface, publicly available here: https://swisscovery.unige.ch

Our Library Information System is Alma and the discovery tool is produced by Primo VE. Both proprietary tools are developed by ExLibris (https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/) and some components can be freely modified. The code used by our institution in this customisation, based mostly on the work done by SLSP (https://github.com/Swiss-Library-Service-Platform), is released here to share with the whole community of users of this same technology.

We have 3 separate views of our interface whose code is available on 3 different repositories:

1. Production View: https://github.com/dis-unige/swisscovery-vu1 
1. Test View: https://github.com/dis-unige/swisscovery-vu2 
1. Development View: https://github.com/dis-unige/swisscovery-vu3
